Attached are a series of experimental sessions during which multiple subjects received 
a cue and performed an action (denoted by classes 2-5). Class 1 corresponds to times the subject was instructed to sit passively. 

For each action, there are 24 features (column 2 to 24). You can ignore the first column of the data.
The last column in the csv file provides the class label.
